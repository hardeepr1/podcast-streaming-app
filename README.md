Podcast Streaming App

## Overview

The Podcast Streaming App is a full-stack web application that enables users to browse, play, and manage podcasts. The system is divided into a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend, with cloud storage integration for media files.

## Components

### 1. Client (Frontend)

- **Framework:** React
- **State Management:** Redux
- **Key Features:**
  - Browse, search, and play podcasts
  - Manage podcasts (CRUD)
  - Responsive UI
- **Structure:**
  - `src/components/`: UI components (Home, Podcasts, Player, etc.)
  - `src/redux/`: Store, actions, reducers
  - `src/api/`: API utility functions

### 2. Server (Backend)

- **Framework:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** MongoDB (assumed)
- **Key Features:**
  - RESTful API for podcasts and authors
  - File upload support (Cloudinary)
  - Data validation and error handling
- **Structure:**
  - `controllers/`: Business logic for routes
  - `models/`: Mongoose schemas
  - `routes/`: API endpoints
  - `utils/`: Helper functions (e.g., Cloudinary integration)

### 3. Cloudinary

- **Purpose:** Store and serve podcast media files (audio/images)
- **Integration:** Via server-side utility functions

---

## Data Flow

1. **User interacts with React UI** (e.g., plays a podcast)
2. **Client sends API request** to Express server
3. **Server processes request**, interacts with MongoDB and/or Cloudinary
4. **Server responds** with data or media URL
5. **Client updates UI** accordingly

## Key API Endpoints (Sample)

- `GET /api/podcasts` - List all podcasts
- `POST /api/podcasts` - Create a new podcast
- `GET /api/podcasts/:id` - Get podcast details
- `PUT /api/podcasts/:id` - Update podcast
- `DELETE /api/podcasts/:id` - Delete podcast
- `POST /api/upload` - Upload media to Cloudinary

This design provides a scalable, maintainable foundation for a modern podcast streaming platform, leveraging popular open-source technologies and cloud services.
